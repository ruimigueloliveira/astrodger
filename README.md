This project aims to develop a game using WebGL technology.

This game consists of a spaceship controlled by the user using the arrow keys or mouse, which flies in space and has to dodge the asteroids that are in its path. As the game progresses, points add up and the number of asteroids increases as well as the ship's speed. The player loses when he collides with an asteroid.
